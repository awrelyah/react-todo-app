# TODO APP with React

I previously made the same todo app with vanilla JS. To learn React I decided to make the same app with React.
I am currently changing things and updating it as I go.

It's nowhere near perfect as I have just started to learn React.

## Functionalities

- Add items to todo list (title, description and due date)
- View todos according to their due date (all, today, week, month)
- Delete and edit todos

# View the page

View it live by clicking [here](https://awrelyah.github.io/react-todo-app/).

## Start the project

To start the project on your computer, run:

### `npm start`
