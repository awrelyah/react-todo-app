# TODO APP with React

I had made the same todo app with vanilla JS. To learn React I decided to make the same app with React.
I am currently changing things and updating it as I go.
It's nowhere near perfect as I have just started to learn React.

## Start the project

To start the project, run:

### `npm start`
