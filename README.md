# TODO APP with React

I had made the same todo app with vanilla JS. To learn React I decided to make the same app with React.
I am currently changing things and updating it as I go.
For example I still need to add sidebar funcionalities and save todos to storage.

It's nowhere near perfect as I have just started to learn React.
